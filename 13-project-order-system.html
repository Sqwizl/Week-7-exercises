    <h3>13. Project: Order Management System</h3>
</body>
<p>
    You are building a simple order management system for a small online store.
    The system needs to handle different types of products and calculate the final price based on specific conditions.
    Create a function `calculatePrice`

    The function should take three arguments: `productType`, `quantity`, and `isMember`.

    - `productType` will be a string representing the type of product (e.g., "electronics", "clothing", "grocery").
    - `quantity` will be an integer representing the number of items.
    - `isMember` will be a boolean indicating whether the customer is a store member (true/false).

    Set up base prices:
    - Electronics: $100 per item
    - Clothing: $50 per item
    - Grocery: $20 per item

    Apply discounts and conditions:
    - If the customer is a member, apply a 10% discount on the total price.
    - If the customer buys more than 5 items of any product type, apply an additional 5% discount on the total price.
    - Ensure that the discounts are applied in the correct order (first membership discount, then bulk discount).

    Return the final price: The function should return the final price as a number.

    ### Example Outputs

    - `calculatePrice("electronics", 3, true)` should return `270` (300 - 10% discount).
    - `calculatePrice("clothing", 6, false)` should return `285` (300 - 5% discount).
    - `calculatePrice("grocery", 7, true)` should return `119` (140 - 10% discount - 5% discount).

    ### Bonus Challenge

    Modify the function to add a special promotion: if the total price after discounts exceeds $500, apply a $50
    discount.
