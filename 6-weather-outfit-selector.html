    <h3>6. Weather Outfit Selector</h3>

    <p>
        Create a script that suggests what to wear based on the weather. You input a temperature, and the script tells
        you what to wear.
        <br>
        You should have a form with a text input field and a button. When the button is clicked, the script should
        suggest what to wear based on the temperature.
        For example, if it's cold (under 15 degrees), suggest wearing a jacket. If it's warm, but not hot (between 15
        and 25 degrees), suggest a jumper. if it's hot (above 25 degrees), suggest shorts.
        <br>
