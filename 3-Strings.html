        3.1 - <b>STRING CONCATENATNG</b> - The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.
        The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined
        by an operator.
        The + operator concatenates (adds) strings.

        3.5 - <b>STRING INTERPOLATION</b> -String interpolation is a way to build strings by
        inserting variables or expressions directly into a string,instead of concatenating them with the + operator.
        In JavaScript, this is done using template literals, which are strings wrapped in backticks (` `) rather than
        quotes. You place variables inside ${ }.

            Interpolate a string with a variable that stores a number.</b><br>
        let carBrand = "Toyota";
        let carModel = "Corolla";
        let carYear = 2020;

        console.log(`I drive a ${carYear} ${carBrand} ${carModel}.`);
        <br> Output: I drive a 2020 Toyota Corolla.
        <script>
            let carBrand = "Toyota";
            let carModel = "Corolla";
